<p>There are <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">hundreds of static site generators</a>. Why make yet another?</p>
<p>The short answer is that none of the <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/static-site-generators/comparison.html">static site generators I tested out</a> did what I wanted out of the box (or required too much setup).</p>
<p>The most common issues were:</p>
<ul>
<li>No support for relative links between Markdown files (that get translated to corresponding HTML files at build time)</li>
<li>No support for implicit categorization</li>
<li>No relative link checking at build time</li>
<li>Unintuitive/verbose template languages</li>
<li>Requiring a huge runtime I didn&#39;t want to install</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some specific notes on popular SSGs:</p>
<h1 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h1>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is probably the closest to what I was looking for, but I had no interest in setting up a Ruby environment or learning about the language (in case I needed to author my own plugins). I also didn&#39;t like the verbose syntax of the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> template language.</p>
<h1 id="hugo">Hugo</h1>
<p>Given that <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is broadly used and ships in a convenient single binary, I thought I would end up using Hugo. Unfortunately, it was <em>too</em> general, and it wasn&#39;t obvious how to go from a blank repository to a dev blog. Hugo&#39;s template language was also the most unintuitive template language I ran across during my research.</p>
<h1 id="pelican">Pelican</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> seems like &quot;Jekyll in Python&quot;, but I honestly didn&#39;t seriously consider it because I&#39;ve had so many compatibility issues with Python in the past, that I generally try to avoid Python entirely. I realize I&#39;m in the minority on this, but any language that practically requires virtual environments due to breaking changes seems too fragile for my delicate constitution.</p>
<h1 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h1>
<p>I actually started out using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> because it was very simple and easy to understand, but I ended up preferring <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> (on which md2blog was originally built) because Metalsmith was <em>even simpler</em>, to the point that I could easily understand everything it was doing, instead of having to guess.</p>
<h1 id="metalsmith">Metalsmith</h1>
<p>I originally used <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> for md2blog, but the dependency tree quickly grew out of control and recent security incidents on NPM made me wary of using so many packages from contributors I didn&#39;t trust.</p>
<h1 id="gatsby">Gatsby</h1>
<p>I wasn&#39;t interested in <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> because I don&#39;t want to run a bunch of client JavaScript to hopefully speed up subsequent page loads. Perhaps I&#39;m being unreasonable, but I want a static site generator to spit out HTML, not a web app.</p>
<h1 id="hexo">Hexo</h1>
<p><a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> sounds like it might be a great static site generator, but by the time I gave it a serious look, I was already building on Eleventy (and later Metalsmith), so I didn&#39;t investigate Hexo further. I realize this isn&#39;t a great reason for skipping Hexo.</p>

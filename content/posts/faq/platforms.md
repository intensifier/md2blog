title: What platforms does md2blog run on?
date: 2021-11-10

md2blog is based on [Deno](https://deno.land/), so it only runs on platforms that Deno supports. Here's the current list (copied from [Deno's install page](https://deno.land/manual@v1.16.4/getting_started/installation)):

* Linux (x64 only)
* Windows (x64 only)
* macOS (x64 and arm64)

Note that md2blog is only regularly tested on Linux and Windows, although there are reports that it works on macOS (apart from the [pre-built binaries not being signed](common-problems.md#developer-cannot-be-verified-error-on-macos)).
